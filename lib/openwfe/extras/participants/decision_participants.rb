    # Using CSV files to transform workitems

    #       set :field => "weather", :value => "cloudy"
    #       set :field => "month", :value => "may"
    #       decision
    #       _print "${f:take_umbrella?}"

    #   in:weather, in:month, out:take_umbrella?
    #   ,,
    #   raining,  ,     yes

    #   cloudy,   june,   yes
    #   cloudy,   may,    yes
    #   cloudy,   ,     no
    #   """)

    #   # ...
    #
    #   engine.launch(new OpenWFE::LaunchItem(TestDefinition0)
    #
    # Note that the CsvParticipant constructor also accepts a block.
    #
