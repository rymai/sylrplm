    #
    # Use Jabber (XMPP) during a workflow to communicate with people/processes
    # outside the running engine in an asynchrous fashion.
    #
    # The JabberParticipant will send a JSON encoded InFlowWorkItem to a Jabber
    # ID specified in the 'target_id' attribute of the workitem's attributes.
    # To change the format sent, use the 'message_format' attribute of the
    # workitem, and set it to either 'XML' or 'YAML' (defaults to 'JSON').
    #
    # You can specify the JID, password and JID resource names on class level
    # or by passing the :jabber_id, :password, or :resource keys to the
    # construct. By default the 'participant' resoure is used.
    #
    # The roster management is currently dynamic as well. It will clear the
    # roster when it starts, except for a hard coded list of contacts. As
    # messages are sent out the roster will be populated with those JID's,
    # making sure that the listener will respond to replies.
    #
    # Configuration example:
    #
    #   engine.register_participant(
    #     :jabber,
    #     OpenWFE::Extras::JabberParticipant.new( :jabber_id => 'ruote@devbox', :password => 'secret', :contacts => ['kenneth@devbox'] )
    #   )
    #
    # Process example:
    #
    #   class JabberProcess < OpenWFE::ProcessDefinition
    #     sequence do
    #       jabber :wait_for_reply => true
    #     end
    #
    #     set :f => 'target_jid', :val => 'kenneth.kalmer@gmail.com'
    #   end
    #
    # Passing the 'wait_for_reply' parameter to the participant
    # prevents it from replying to the engine, and thus expects the
    # JabberListener to pick up the reply and let the process
    # continue. By default the JabberParticipant will send the message
    # and reply to the engine, letting the workflow continue.
