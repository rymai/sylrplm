module OpenWFE
  #
  # This module gets included into the result of the expression pool (and
  # engine) process_stack method (if the optional parameter 'unapplied' is
  # set to true).
  #
  # It adds a representation() method that returns an up-to-date
  # representation of the executing process instance.
  # This representation is suitable for 'fluo' rendering.
  #
  module RepresentationMixin
    #
    # Computes and returns the up-to-date representation of
    # the process definition (on the fly changes included)

    # A 'representation' is an array
    # [ expression_name, attributes, children_expression ] where
    # expression_name is a String, attributes a Hash and children_expression
    # an Array of representations.
